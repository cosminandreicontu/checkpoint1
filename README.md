### Part 1: Algorithms

Solve the following exercises, see the intructions in each file: 

> algo1.js

> algo2.js

> (**BONUS**) algo3.js

### Part 2: Gallery with Bootstrap or not

Create an `index.html` and an `index.css`. 

Create a gallery of recipe photos. If you want, you can do it with the Bootstrap grid system. 
Get some photos here: https://pixabay.com/images/search/recipes/?orientation=horizontal 

The grid should follow these layouts: 
* Desktop: 4x6
* Tablet: 2x12
* Smartphone: 1x24

[Bonus (if you have more time)]

Use [jQuery Fancybox 3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) to create a lightbox gallery.
